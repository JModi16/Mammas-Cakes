# Mammas-Cakes

![Website mock-up](media/docs/mockup.png)

Mammas Cakes is an e-commerce website project created for a imaginary bake shop in UK. The main goal of this project was to create the most user-friendly website possible, where you can shop for cakes in an easy and intuitive way. The user can view collection of products, place an order  as a collection or delivery . Users need to register their login credentials and be authenticated before placing an order. Registered users also have the option to view their order history  

Project was created using Python, Django, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database manipulation and deployed using Heroku. Mammas Cakes is my third milestone project for Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.
